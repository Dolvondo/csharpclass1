Personally, loops are my favorite. They have the ability to repeat a same action.
I use loops to control several objects at once using arrays, giving me the ability
to run several objects that I didnt have to personally code for each.

to use a loop:  for (int i ; i < a ; i++) {}  a loop uses "for"
And the for loop's structure is nearly identical to JavaScript.
The difference between the two is int i, and in C# it provides the ability to identify a variable's type.

in this loop, "i" will continually increase by increments of 1 until it is greater than "a" and it will no longer run.
