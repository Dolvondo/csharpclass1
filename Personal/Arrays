Arrays:

Instead of declaring a variable one at a time, arrays give the oppurtunity to store more with typing less. For example, Arrays and for loops work
together very well and spontaneously. An example of using for loops and arrays would be for a gravity simulator. If you were placing
several stars in orbit it would be a pain to program each star one at a time. Well, with arrays you don't need to because it can store a
collection of data instead.
