Notes:

static - means reachable by other files, "Global" - referencing the cookie cutter
public - Viewable by other objects "Is an access modifier"
instancing - is a copy of an object - is the cookie, but not the same as other cookies
class - Is the cookie cutter. And they make objects. Also used to assign attributes to other variables that reference the class
private - private variables are not accessible outside of the script where it was made
reference - anything that is static is referenced. Data that mention the source of data and uses it.
constructor - is the same name as the class and is called when the class is run. When it loads into your RAM the constructor runs. Common in javascript.
    - Runs before programs run
    - Building things the class needs to run

Strategies -
--- Classes are objects that can store/(give away) attributes, which variables can ask for and assign themselves a default attribute. Another file will be for actually setting the proper
stats for the variable. This reduces repatitive clutter.


Errors:
